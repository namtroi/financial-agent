Record $21.6B Backlog: Why This Builder Has Work Lined Up for Years

Tutor Perini just strapped more cargo onto a very full ship: backlog hit an all-time high of $21.6 billion as of September 30, 2025. That’s not fluff — it’s confirmed work sitting in the pipeline that should drive revenue for years. For a company that builds big, complicated projects, a backlog this large is the equivalent of long-term ticket sales — it’s future revenue visibility, and investors should pay attention.

This surge didn’t come from one lucky bid. It’s the result of several quarters of aggressive, selective wins and faster project ramp-ups. The company booked $3.1 billion in new awards in Q2 2025 and another $2.0 billion in Q3 2025, including marquee projects such as the roughly $1 billion UCSF Benioff New Children’s Hospital, a $182 million defense project in Guam, and other building- and civil-focused work. More recently, one of Tutor Perini’s subsidiaries landed a pair of Northern California contracts totaling $408 million (a $253M UC Davis utility-plant expansion and a $155M performing-arts building for City College of San Francisco). Put together, that mix shows Tutor Perini is winning both large, long-duration civil work and higher-margin building trades — the combo investors like when they want steadier, growing cash flows.

Show Me the Numbers — the quick scorecard (and what each number means)
- Backlog: $21.6 billion (Sept 30, 2025) — the company’s confirmed pipeline; more than enough work to support multi-year revenue growth.  
- Revenue (Q3 2025): $1.42 billion, +31% year-over-year — proof projects are moving from backlog into billing.  
- Operating cash flow: $289 million (Q3); $574 million (first 9 months of 2025) — think of this as the company’s paycheck after paying suppliers and crews; it’s unusually strong and a key source for debt reduction or returns to shareholders.  
- Total debt: $413 million (Sept 30, 2025), down from $534M at end-2024; cash exceeded debt by $283M — balance sheet moving from leveraged toward net-cash position.  
- CIE (costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings): $848 million (Sept 30, 2025), down $95M since year-end 2024 — a lower CIE usually signals fewer unresolved disputes and cleaner working capital.  
- 2025 adjusted EPS guidance: raised to $4.00–$4.20 (adjusted excludes share-based compensation volatility) — management expects materially better earnings after stripping one-time stock-linked accounting swings.

Here’s what that means for a new investor: overall, this is growth with improving stability. Tutor Perini is moving from a patchwork of legacy issues into a phase where large, higher-margin projects and record cash generation are front-and-center. The company has been converting backlog into billings and cash, shrinking net debt, and raising guidance — all classic signs that operations are trending healthier. Experienced investors will watch two things closely: whether cash flow stays strong as mobils and early payments normalize, and whether the company continues to win high-quality work (not just volume).

The catch you should know: the biggest fly in the ointment is volatile share-based compensation and the normal risks of large construction contracts. Tutor Perini’s share-based compensation expense has ballooned with the stock rally (it added tens of millions to quarterly G&A), which complicates GAAP earnings — that’s why management highlights “Adjusted EPS.” More fundamentally, big projects carry execution and dispute risks; although CIE is down (good), unresolved disputes and cost overruns on multi-year builds can still hit margins and working capital. Finally, while management says it doesn’t expect tariffs, funding cuts, or government shutdowns to materially impact current projects, changes in public funding or major cancellations would be the sharpest tailwinds to watch for.

Bottom line — Tutor Perini looks like a construction company that has turned a corner: a stacked backlog, record cash generation, falling net debt and rising adjusted earnings expectations. For investors starting out, the story is growth backed by cash — but priced with the usual construction risks and some accounting noise from stock-linked pay. If you own the stock or are considering it, watch upcoming cash flow reports and new-award quality (not just headline dollars) — those will tell you whether this momentum sticks.
