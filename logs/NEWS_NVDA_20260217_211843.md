Nvidia Guides to $65B Ahead of Feb. 25 Earnings: Shows AI Demand Is Turning into Real Revenue

Nvidia just put a big, bright number on the table: management is guiding roughly $65 billion for the fiscal quarter that ends in late January, and Wall Street’s consensus sits around $65.6 billion ahead of the company’s Feb. 25 earnings report. That’s not small change — it’s a signal that the surge in AI spending we’ve heard about is moving out of PowerPoint slides and into shipping pallets and invoices. If that guidance holds, it would make the coming report one of the most important corporate snapshots of the AI cycle so far.

This isn’t an isolated bump. Back in November Nvidia reported record fiscal Q3 revenue of $57.0 billion — up 62% year‑over‑year and 22% sequentially — and CEO Jensen Huang has described demand for the new Blackwell data‑center platform as “off the charts.” At the same time the company has been signing partnerships and deals — an expanded multiyear AI infrastructure pact with Meta and ecosystem moves like Fortanix and NTT DATA working with Nvidia technology on data‑sovereignty and AI factory solutions. Think of Nvidia as the engine and a growing set of big customers as the fuel tank being filled: the engine’s revving, and more organizations are lining up to put their foot on the gas.

Those qualitative signs are backed by hard numbers and market context. Nvidia is now one of the largest companies on the market, and analysts remain broadly bullish heading into earnings — many are reiterating buy ratings and pointing to continued Blackwell ramp and next‑generation processors coming in 2026. Management’s guidance does carry a notable constraint: it assumes no data‑center GPU sales to China, which effectively means growth is being booked without counting a sizable, uncertain market.

Key numbers to keep pinned to your mental bulletin board:
- Fiscal Q3 revenue (reported Nov. 19, 2025): $57.0 billion (up 62% YoY, up 22% sequentially)  
- Fiscal Q4 guidance (company): ~$65.0 billion; Wall Street consensus: ~$65.58 billion  
- Wall Street Q4 EPS estimate: ~$1.52 per share  
- Market snapshot (from Yahoo Finance): Market cap ≈ $4.44 trillion; trailing P/E ≈ 45.25; forward P/E ≈ 23.75  
- Trailing 12‑month revenue ≈ $187.14 billion; net income ≈ $99.2 billion; cash ≈ $60.6 billion

What this means for a new investor: Nvidia is no longer just a “hot” stock tied to hype — it’s converting massive AI demand into very large revenue streams. Experienced investors will watch whether the Feb. 25 results beat the high bar set by guidance and whether management raises forward guidance — that’s the real acid test. If Nvidia prints numbers close to guidance and reiterates strong demand, the narrative that GPUs and the Blackwell platform are the backbone of enterprise AI spending will get even stronger.

The catch you should watch: geopolitical and supply dynamics. Management’s guidance explicitly assumes no data‑center AI chip sales to China — meaning a major market remains uncertain and could swing future results if access changes. Also, when a company gets this big, expectations become a fragile thing: even a beat can disappoint if future guidance is conservative. Finally, partnerships and deals (like with Meta) show reach but don’t guarantee sustained margins if competitors or regulatory issues change the landscape. In short: the runway looks long, but keep an eye on China exposure, guidance tone, and whether demand stays “off the charts” once orders translate into shipped units and recurring revenue.
