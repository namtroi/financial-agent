The Company delivered solid year-over-year growth across all three segments through the first nine months of 2025, primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain newer, larger and higher-margin projects, all of which have significant scope of work remaining.\n\nRevenue for the Civil and Specialty Contractors segments for the third quarter of 2025 was up 41% and 124%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year. The Civil segment's revenue for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 were the segment's highest ever for the respective periods, as market demand for construction projects remains strong and the Company continues to capitalize on major bidding opportunities.\n\nIncome from construction operations for the third quarter of 2025 was $40.1 million, up significantly compared to a loss from construction operations of $106.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase was principally due to higher-margin contributions related to the increased project execution activities discussed above, as well as the absence of certain net unfavorable adjustments that impacted results for the third quarter of 2024. The Company's income from construction operations for the third quarter of 2025 reflected a $42.2 million ($0.77 per diluted share) increase in share-based compensation expense compared to the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to continued growth in the Company’s stock price, which was up 171% year-to-date through the end of the third quarter of 2025, affecting the fair value of liability-classified awards.\n\nNet income attributable to the Company for the third quarter of 2025 was $3.6 million, or EPS of $0.07, up substantially compared to net loss attributable to the Company of $100.9 million, or a $1.92 diluted loss per share, for the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted net income attributable to the Company, which excludes the impact of share-based compensation expense, net of associated tax benefit, for the third quarter of 2025 was $61.9 million, or $1.15 of Adjusted EPS, compared to Adjusted net loss attributable to the Company, which also excludes the impact of share-based compensation expense, net of associated tax benefit, of $84.5 million, or $1.61 of Adjusted diluted loss per share, for the third quarter of 2024. Please refer to the *Non-GAAP Financial Measures* section below for further information and a reconciliation of the Company's financial results reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) to the reported adjusted results.\n\n**Record Operating Cash Flow**\n\nThe Company generated $289.1 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter of 2025 and $574.4 million in the first nine months of 2025, both of which set new records for each respective period, and both up significantly compared to $22.6 million and $174.0 million for the same periods last year. The Company's operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2025 was the second-highest result of any quarter. The record operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2025 was largely driven by collections from newer and ongoing projects and, to a much lesser extent, from collections related to recent dispute resolutions.\n\nThe Company expects strong annual operating cash flows to continue well beyond 2025.\n\n**Record Backlog**\n\nThe Company booked $2.0 billion of new awards and contract adjustments in the third quarter of 2025, demonstrating its ongoing success in capturing significant new project opportunities resulting from a combination of its strategic bidding approach and favorable market dynamics, including limited competition in certain markets for some of the largest, most complex projects. This environment, which is supported by strong public and private customer funding and demand, has allowed the Company to differentiate itself and deliver compelling proposals that align with customers' goals and expectations.\n\nAs a result of the strong new awards activity, the Company's backlog grew to a new record of $21.6 billion as of September 30, 2025, up 54% compared to the backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Backlog for the Building and Specialty Contractors segments as of September 30, 2025 also set new records. The most significant new awards and contract adjustments in the third quarter of 2025 included:\n\nThe Company expects its backlog will remain strong due in part to certain Building segment projects currently in the preconstruction phase that are anticipated to advance to the construction phase later this year and in 2026 and 2027. Tutor Perini expects to continue bidding selectively on various project opportunities that will drive long-term shareholder value. The Company continues to have significant project bidding opportunities, particularly on the West Coast, in the Midwest, and in the Indo-Pacific region, and remains well positioned to continue winning its share of new projects over the next several years.\n\n**Significant Balance Sheet Improvements**\n\nTotal debt as of September 30, 2025 was $413 million, down 23% compared to $534 million at the end of 2024. As a result of the record operating cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date in 2025, the Company's cash exceeded its total debt by $283 million as of September 30, 2025, maintaining the Company's balance sheet in a strong net cash position. In addition, the Company's balance of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings (\"CIE\") was $848 million as of September 30, 2025, down $95 million, or 10%, compared to the balance at the end of 2024 and at the lowest level it has been since the second quarter of 2017. This reduction in CIE was primarily driven by the resolution and billing of various previously disputed matters.\n\n**Management Remarks**\n\n\"Tutor Perini's third-quarter results were outstanding across all key metrics and demonstrate our continued business momentum and success in delivering solid operating performance, with healthy profit margins in the Civil and Building segments and a return to profitability in the Specialty Contractors segment,\" said Gary Smalley, Tutor Perini's Chief Executive Officer and President.\n\n\"We are benefiting from favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, which are driving strong market demand for construction services across all our segments. We remain focused on capitalizing on a range of attractive bidding opportunities, which resulted in Tutor Perini securing $2 billion of new awards this quarter, increasing our backlog to a new record of $21.6 billion. We continue to expect the long-duration and higher-margin nature of projects in backlog to translate into significantly higher revenue and earnings over the next several years.\"\n\n\"Our record operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2025 is already well in excess of last year's full-year record cash flow, and we expect to continue generating strong cash flow for the rest of this year and beyond. Furthermore, our earnings to date are considerably higher than expected, enabling us to confidently raise our full-year earnings guidance for the third consecutive quarter,\" added Mr. Smalley.\n\n**Outlook and Raising Guidance**\n\nTutor Perini's business has continued to perform extremely well through the first nine months of 2025, and the Company anticipates solid operating performance and financial results over the rest of this year, with significantly higher revenue and earnings still expected in 2026 and 2027 as various newer large projects advance to the construction phase.\n\nBased on the Company's excellent year-to-date results in 2025 and management's increased confidence in its performance trajectory for the remainder of the year, the Company is raising its 2025 Adjusted EPS guidance, with Adjusted EPS now expected in the range of $4.00 to $4.20 (up from $3.65 to $3.95). Based on current projections, the Company continues to expect that Adjusted EPS for 2026 and 2027 will be significantly higher than the upper end of its increased 2025 guidance. The Company's increased guidance continues to factor in a significant amount of contingency for various unknown or unexpected developments in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThe Company is no longer providing forward-looking guidance for GAAP EPS or a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EPS guidance to GAAP EPS guidance because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting share-based compensation expense, which fluctuates with future share price movements, without unreasonable efforts. Variations in share-based compensation expense could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period.\n\nThe Company continues to see strong demand for its services, driven by well-funded state, local and federal customers that have numerous large-scale, high-priority infrastructure projects planned over the next several years, as well as by certain commercial customers that continue to advance projects for new or renovated buildings in vibrant end markets, such as healthcare, education, and hospitality and gaming.\n\nTutor Perini still does not currently anticipate any significant impacts from recently imposed tariffs, the curtailment of federal funding for certain projects, or the recent federal government shutdown, but continues to closely monitor these issues.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented under GAAP, we are presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional insights that facilitate the comparison of our past and present performance, and they are among the indicators management uses to assess the Company’s financial performance and to forecast future performance. By including these non-GAAP financial measures, we aim to provide investors and stakeholders a clearer understanding of our operating results and enhance transparency with respect to the key financial metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude share-based compensation expense (as well as the tax benefit associated with the expense), include adjusted net income (loss) attributable to the Company and adjusted earnings (loss) per share. We exclude share-based compensation expense because this expense could result in significant volatility in our reported earnings, driven primarily by fluctuations in the expense recognized for certain long-term incentive compensation awards with payouts that are indexed to the Company’s common stock. By adjusting for share-based compensation, our non-GAAP measures present a supplemental depiction of our operational performance and financial health. This approach allows stakeholders to focus on our core operational efficiency and profitability without the variable impact to earnings caused by significant changes in our stock price. Our non-GAAP measures are intended to offer a consistent basis for evaluating the Company’s performance, which management believes is meaningful to stakeholders.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release as calculated by the Company are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\n\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are found in the table below:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | | |  | | |  |  | | |  | | |\n|  | **Three Months Ended  September 30,** | | | | | |  | **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,** | | | | | |\n| *(in millions, except per common share amounts)* |  | **2025** |  |  | **2024** |  |  |  | **2025** |  |  | **2024** |  |\n| Net income (loss) attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation, as reported | $ | 3.6 |  | $ | (100.9 | ) |  | $ | 51.6 |  | $ | (84.3 | ) |\n| Plus: Share-based compensation expense(a) |  | 58.7 |  |  | 16.5 |  |  |  | 120.7 |  |  | 39.0 |  |\n| Less: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense |  | (0.4 | ) |  | (0.1 | ) |  |  | (0.9 | ) |  | (0.5 | ) |\n| Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation | $ | 61.9 |  | $ | (84.5 | ) |  | $ | 171.4 |  | $ | (45.8 | ) |\n|  |  | | |  | | |  |  | | |  | | |\n| Diluted earnings (loss) per common share, as reported | $ | 0.07 |  | $ | (1.92 | ) |  | $ | 0.97 |  | $ | (1.61 | ) |\n| Plus: Share-based compensation expense impact per diluted share |  | 1.09 |  |  | 0.32 |  |  |  | 2.26 |  |  | 0.75 |  |\n| Less: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense per diluted share |  | (0.01 | ) |  | (0.01 | ) |  |  | (0.01 | ) |  | (0.02 | ) |\n| Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per common share | $ | 1.15 |  | $ | (1.61 | ) |  | $ | 3.22 |  | $ | (0.88 | ) |\n\n**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n**Three Months Ended\n  \nSeptember 30,**\n\n**Nine Months Ended****September 30,**\n\n*(in millions, except per common share amounts)*\n\n**2025**\n\n**2024**\n\n**2025**\n\n**2024**\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation, as reported\n\n$\n\n3.6\n\n$\n\n(100.9\n\n)\n\n$\n\n51.6\n\n$\n\n(84.3\n\n)\n\nPlus: Share-based compensation expense(a)\n\n58.7\n\n16.5\n\n120.7\n\n39.0\n\nLess: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense\n\n(0.4\n\n)\n\n(0.1\n\n)\n\n(0.9\n\n)\n\n(0.5\n\n)\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation\n\n$\n\n61.9\n\n$\n\n(84.5\n\n)\n\n$\n\n171.4\n\n$\n\n(45.8\n\n)\n\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share, as reported\n\n$\n\n0.07\n\n$\n\n(1.92\n\n)\n\n$\n\n0.97\n\n$\n\n(1.61\n\n)\n\nPlus: Share-based compensation expense impact per diluted share\n\n1.09\n\n0.32\n\n2.26\n\n0.75\n\nLess: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense per diluted share\n\n(0.01\n\n)\n\n(0.01\n\n)\n\n(0.01\n\n)\n\n(0.02\n\n)\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings (loss) per common share\n\n$\n\n1.15\n\n$\n\n(1.61\n\n)\n\n$\n\n3.22\n\n$\n\n(0.88\n\n)\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ | | |\n| (a) |  | The amount represents share-based compensation expense recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.

These forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential impacts on the Company. While the Company’s expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and the Company believes there is a reasonable basis for them, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the control of the Company) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: unfavorable outcomes of existing or future litigation or dispute resolution proceedings against us or customers (project owners, developers, general contractors, etc.), subcontractors or suppliers, as well as failure to promptly recover significant working capital invested in projects subject to such matters; revisions of estimates of contract risks, revenue or costs; economic factors, such as inflation, tariffs, the timing of new awards, or the pace of project execution, which have resulted and may continue to result in losses or lower than anticipated profit; contract requirements to perform extra work beyond the initial project scope, which has and in the future could result in disputes or claims and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows; risks and other uncertainties associated with estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements; a significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions, such as those presented during a recession; failure to meet contractual schedule requirements, which could result in higher costs and reduced profits or, in some cases, exposure to financial liability for liquidated damages and/or damages to customers, as well as damage to our reputation; possible systems and information technology interruptions and breaches in data security and/or privacy; decreases or delays in the level of federal, state and local government spending for infrastructure and other public projects; an inability to obtain bonding could have a negative impact on our operations and results; inability to attract and retain our key officers, and to adequately plan for their succession, and hire and retain personnel required to execute and perform on our contracts; the impact of inclement weather conditions, disasters and other catastrophic events outside of our control on projects; risks related to our international operations, such as uncertainty of U.S. government funding, as well as economic, political, regulatory and other risks, including risks of loss due to acts of war, labor conditions, and other unforeseeable events in countries where we do business, which could adversely affect our revenue and earnings; client cancellations of, delays in, or reductions in scope under contracts reported in our backlog, as well as prospective project opportunities, including as a result of government-related mandates; failure of our joint venture partners to perform their venture obligations, which could impose additional financial and performance obligations on us, resulting in reduced profits or losses and/or reputational harm; increased competition and failure to secure new contracts; risks related to government contracts (including government shutdowns) and related procurement regulations; violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws; significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders and potentially subject us to securities litigation; failure to meet our obligations under our debt agreements (especially in a high interest rate environment); downgrades in our credit ratings; public health crises, such as COVID-19, have adversely impacted, and could in the future adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operations by, among other things, delaying the timing of project bids and/or awards and the timing of dispute resolutions and associated collections; physical and regulatory risks related to climate change; impairment of our goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets; the exertion of influence over the Company by our executive chairman due to his position and significant ownership interests; and other risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed on February 27, 2025 and in other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.*\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | |

For Q3 2025 the company posted revenue of $1.415 billion (up 31% year-over-year from $1.083 billion), income from construction operations of $40.1 million versus a $106.8 million loss in Q3 2024, and GAAP net income attributable to the company of $3.6 million (EPS $0.07). On an adjusted basis (excluding share-based compensation), Q3 adjusted net income attributable was $61.9 million, or Adjusted EPS of $1.15.\n\nThe quarter also produced exceptional cash metrics: Tutor Perini generated $289.1 million of operating cash flow in Q3 and $574.4 million for the first nine months of 2025 — both record levels for the respective periods. Balance-sheet improvements accompanied the cash generation: total debt declined to $413 million as of September 30, 2025 (down 23% vs. end-2024), and cash exceeded total debt by $283 million at quarter-end. Backlog expanded to a record $21.6 billion as of September 30, 2025 (up 54% year-over-year), reflecting strong award activity.\n\nStrategically, the results validate Tutor Perini’s pivot toward larger, longer-duration, higher-margin projects across Civil, Building and Specialty segments. Civil revenue rose sharply (segment revenue up 41% YoY for the quarter) and Specialty Contractors returned to profitability, demonstrating better execution on newer, higher-margin contracts. The company’s decision to selectively bid and capture large complex work — combined with the ability to self-perform key scopes — appears to be converting backlog into near-term revenue and cash faster than in prior periods.\n\nFor investors, the raise in Adjusted EPS guidance and robust cash generation materially de-risks the company relative to the early-2024 performance. The improvement in operating margins and the conversion of backlog to cash suggest the market should re-evaluate forward cash-flow forecasts; the $4.00–$4.20 Adjusted EPS range for 2025 plus management’s expectation that 2026–2027 Adjusted EPS will be “significantly higher” implies meaningful upside if execution continues. Key risks remain: share-based compensation materially impacts GAAP EPS volatility, and project execution on very large, complex jobs can still produce margin swings. Monitor margin trends on the largest backlog projects and any adverse changes to CIE/billings dynamics.\n\nBroader sector context: public infrastructure funding and select private markets (healthcare, education, hospitality) are driving demand for larger projects, reducing competitive pressure on the largest contractors. Tutor Perini’s improved liquidity and shrinking debt position better position it to pursue design-build and P3 opportunities that require balance-sheet strength and bonding capacity.\n\n---\nRecord Backlog Fuels Multi-Year Revenue Visibility — $2.0B New Awards in Q3, Backlog $21.6B as of Sep 30, 2025\nTPC | 11/05/2025 | Source: Tutor Perini press release (Business Wire / investors.tutorperini.com/press-releases/2025)\n\nTutor Perini booked approximately $2.0 billion of new awards and contract adjustments in Q3 2025 and reported a record backlog of $21.6 billion as of September 30, 2025 (up 54% vs. Q3 2024). The backlog increase was driven by substantial wins across Civil, Building and Specialty segments, and management highlighted that Building and Specialty backlogs also set new records for the period. New awards and backlog composition are explicitly cited as key drivers for materially higher revenue and earnings expected in 2026 and 2027.\n\nIn financial terms, the backlog-to-revenue runway is meaningful relative to current run-rate activity. Revenue for the first nine months of 2025 was $4.035 billion; with $21.6 billion backlog, Tutor Perini has multi-year revenue visibility assuming normal project execution and no material cancellations. The company’s reported income from construction operations for the nine months was $181.8 million, and management noted higher-margin contributions from newer, larger projects — suggesting that backlog quality (not just quantity) is improving. The company also disclosed $7.0 billion of new awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, underpinning the backlog growth.\n\nStrategically, a deeper, higher-margin backlog aligns with Tutor Perini’s stated focus on selectively bidding larger, complex projects where competition is limited and outcomes can deliver better margins. The backlog composition favors long-duration work that typically converts to stable revenue and cash over several years, which supports the company’s guidance lift and the expectation of “significantly higher” Adjusted EPS in 2026–2027. The reduction in CIE (costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings) to $848 million and the notable increase in billings-in-excess-of-costs to $1.904 billion suggest healthier working capital conversion in the short term.\n\nFor investors, a $21.6 billion backlog materially increases visibility into future top-line and operating-cash outcomes, and reduces near-term revenue volatility compared with a thinner backlog. The market should price in both the upside from backlog conversion and the execution risk inherent in large projects (schedule delays, claims, and margin reversals). Key monitoring items are realized margins on the largest projects, change-order recognition cadence, and working capital trends — particularly retention receivables and billings-in-excess-of-costs which affect liquidity.\n\nFrom an industry perspective, backlog scale is increasingly a competitive moat in the current environment of large public infrastructure plans and selective private development. Contractors with balance-sheet strength and demonstrated execution on complex scopes are winning a disproportionate share of large awards. Tutor Perini’s backlog positions it to harvest those secular trends if it can maintain execution discipline and margin controls.\n\n---\nTutor Perini Awarded $900M USACE Middle East District Multiple-Award Task Order Contract\nTPC | 12/16/2025 | Source: Tutor Perini corporate news (tutorperini.com/news/)\n\nTutor Perini announced on December 16, 2025, that it has been awarded a $900 million U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Middle East District multiple-award task order contract (MATOC). The company’s news item lists the award value at $900 million; specifics on the scope and timing were not detailed in the public summary. A MATOC of this size gives Tutor Perini access to a pipeline of military and government work in a geopolitically strategic region and can generate sizable task-level awards over the contract term.\n\nFinancially, a $900 million MATOC is material relative to Tutor Perini’s quarterly revenue scale (Q3 revenue $1.415 billion) and supports the company’s sizable backlog ($21.6 billion). While MATOCs do not always translate immediately into revenue because task orders are awarded incrementally, access to a task-order ceiling of $900 million can meaningfully lift civil and specialty revenue streams over the contract’s life — particularly in higher-margin infrastructure and defense-related work. The company’s recent strong cash generation and reduced net debt position ($cash exceeded total debt by $283 million at Sep 30, 2025) improve its ability to self-perform and mobilize for USACE task orders.\n\nStrategically the award underscores Tutor Perini’s push into well-funded government projects and international markets where program scale favors larger general contractors capable of complex logistics and compliance. Winning a MATOC with USACE — a repeat customer for many large U.S. contractors — reinforces Tutor Perini’s credentials in heavy civil and infrastructure work, strengthens relationships with federal buyers, and can open the door to follow-on task orders and prime positions on consortia in the Indo-Pacific/ME theater.\n\nInvestor implications hinge on task-order conversion and the margins earned on awarded task orders. If Tutor Perini converts this MATOC into award-winning task orders with typical infrastructure margins, the contract could support steady revenue and cash flow in coming years. However, timing and execution risks remain: task orders may be slow-to-award, and overseas work carries geopolitical, payment and performance risk. Investors should watch the company’s disclosures for the first task orders under the MATOC, estimated margins, and any required mobilization or capital expenditures tied to Middle East operations.\n\nIn the broader macro context, increased U.S. government defense and reconstruction spending in some regions has created attractive opportunities for contractors with established compliance and execution capabilities. Tutor Perini’s access to this $900 million ceiling is consistent with the industry trend of defense and federal customers leaning on experienced, financially stable builders for large-scale programs.\n\n---\nTutor Perini Subsidiary Wins $408M in Northern California Work — UC Davis Utility Plant ($253M) and Diego Rivera Performing Arts Center ($155M)\nTPC | Jan 2026 | Source: Los Angeles Business Journal (labusinessjournal.com)\n\nTutor Perini, through one of its subsidiaries (Rudolph and Sletten), secured two Northern California contracts with a combined value of $408 million: a $253 million contract to expand the central utility plant at UC Davis Health’s Sacramento campus and a $155 million contract to build the Diego Rivera Performing Arts Center at City College of San Francisco. The UC Davis project includes a new two-story, 32,000-square-foot annex housing three new generators and upgrades to the existing plant; substantial completion is anticipated in fall 2027. The Diego Rivera project is a 78,000-square-foot performing arts facility featuring a 631-seat main theater and a 90-seat recital hall.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, $408 million of work represents material customer-funded building segment opportunities relative to Tutor Perini’s Q3 revenue of $1.415 billion and contributes to the company’s record backlog (which reached $21.6 billion as of Sep 30, 2025). The UC Davis utility plant, given its scope (generators and central plant systems), typically involves high equipment and specialty subcontracting content and should carry steady margins consistent with medical campus infrastructure work. The performing arts center is a complex building job with architectural finishes and specialized MEP systems — work that can produce stable margins but requires careful contract and schedule management.\n\nStrategically, these awards reinforce Tutor Perini’s Building segment competency in mission-critical institutional projects (healthcare facilities and civic/cultural buildings). Securing both a major university health campus utility project and a high-profile civic performing arts center demonstrates the company’s ability to execute technically sophisticated work in dense, regulated urban environments. For a subsidiary like Rudolph and Sletten, such wins strengthen local market presence in Northern California and can create follow-on opportunities in healthcare, education and civic projects.\n\nFor investors, these contracts diversify the company’s near-term revenue mix and add mid-sized, higher-visibility projects to backlog that typically convert to revenue within 18–36 months. The UC Davis project’s anticipated fall-2027 substantial completion provides clear revenue runway; however, investors should monitor potential scheduling risks, change-order recoverability, and the timing of billings versus costs (retentions). Overall, these awards complement Tutor Perini’s strategy to capture higher-margin building opportunities alongside its larger civil backlog.\n\nIndustry-wise, municipal and institutional capital spending remains a steady demand source for contractors focused on healthcare and civic projects, especially where state and local funding aligns with capital renewal cycles. Tutor Perini’s wins reflect continuing regional momentum in institutional construction markets.\n\n---\nTutor Perini Secures $53M Design Change Order on Honolulu City Center Guideway and Stations Project; Extension Boosts Building Segment Revenue Potential\nTPC | 12/29/2025 | Source: Tutor Perini press release (investors.tutorperini.com/press-releases/2025)\n\nOn December 29, 2025, Tutor Perini disclosed a $53 million design change order award for an extension to the City Center guideway and stations project in Honolulu. The company characterized the award as a design change order (DCO) — an addition to an existing contract scope — rather than a standalone new contract. The DCO covers extension work to the City Center guideway and stations and adds $53 million to the contract value for that project.\n\nFinancially, $53 million is a modest but meaningful add-on relative to quarterly revenue (Q3 revenue $1.415 billion) and contributes incrementally to backlog and near-term revenue recognition. As a design change order, this award is likely to be executed within the established project framework and schedule, implying lower mobilization costs and clearer billing mechanics versus greenfield awards. The company’s overall nine-month revenue of $4.036 billion and record backlog position ($21.6 billion) means this DCO increases visibility on the Building segment’s near-term work without materially altering the company’s overall financial profile.\n\nStrategically, DCOs are an important margin and cash-growth mechanism for contractors: they reflect the contractor’s ability to capture and realize scope changes, recover variations, and maintain customer relationships on major urban transit projects. Successfully negotiating and executing a $53 million DCO in a high-profile public transit program underscores Tutor Perini’s role as a principal contractor capable of managing complex interfaces with public agencies and project stakeholders in Honolulu’s constrained urban environment.\n\nFor investors, this DCO signals two practical implications: (1) it demonstrates the potential for existing megaprojects in Tutor Perini’s backlog to yield incremental revenue and margin through change orders, helping to close the gap between booked backlog and recognized revenue; and (2) it reduces execution risk associated with under-bid extras because the work has been formally added and priced. Watch for the company’s disclosures on timing of recognition and any impact to project margin; DCOs can be margin-accretive if priced appropriately, but conversely can be a source of disputes if scope and change-order language are ambiguous.\n\nIn the broader context of transit and urban infrastructure, many projects continue to undergo scope adjustments tied to site conditions, community requirements, and funding refinements. Contractors that can capture change orders cleanly improve realized returns on large projects without the need to win new awards — a positive dynamic for return on invested capital in the sector."
