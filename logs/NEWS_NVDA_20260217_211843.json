          "raw_content": "![The Motley Fool](https://g.foolcdn.com/misc-assets/logo-tmf-primary-1-magenta-purple-reversed.svg?_w=320)\n![The Motley Fool](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Fmisc-assets%2Ftmf_holdingco_logo_stacked_magenta_royalpurple_rev.png&w=96&op=resize)\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) tech leader has beaten the analyst consensus earnings estimate in 20 of the past 22 quarters.\n\n**Nvidia** ([NVDA](/quote/nasdaq/nvda/) +1.12%) is scheduled to report its results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Jan. 25) on Wednesday, Feb. 25, after the market close.\n\nNvidia's earnings have become the most anticipated during the quarterly earnings season over the last few years. Its status as the leading maker of [artificial intelligence](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/) (AI) chips and related AI infrastructure has made it a bellwether, or indicator, for the AI market. Moreover, to some degree, Nvidia is also considered a bellwether for the entire stock market. That's because it's the most valuable company on the **S&P 500** index.\n\nRecent events suggest Nvidia will post fantastic quarterly results.\n\n![Humanoid robot in front of a digital board with \"AI\" lit up.](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F856658%2Fnvda-stock-earnings-when-q4-earnings-date-best-ai-stocks-to-buy.jpg&w=3840&op=resize)\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n## Recent events point to a blow-out quarter\n\nFirst, the hyperscalers ([big tech companies](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/magnificent-seven/) that operate huge data centers) and other major software companies said they would further increase their already massive capital expenditures in 2026, with most of that spending going toward AI. This higher spending on AI data center buildouts is a big positive for Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the markets for AI model training and AI inference (application deployment).\n\nSecond, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, in a November interview following the release of the company's fiscal Q2 results, described the demand for the company's new Blackwell platform data center products as \"off the charts.\" At that time, Nvidia was scaling up production of Blackwell AI-enabling products to meet powerful demand. Moreover, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in January, Huang's presentation slides included one that described demand for AI computing products as \"insane.\"\n\n## Nvidia's fiscal Q4 guidance and Wall Street's estimates\n\n| Metric | Q4 Fiscal 2025 Result | Nvidia's Q4 Fiscal 2026 Guidance | Nvidia's Projected Growth | Wall Street's Q4 Fiscal 2026 Consensus Estimate | Wall Street's Projected Growth |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue | $39.33 billion | $65 billion | 65% | $65.58 billion | 67% |\n| Adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share (EPS) | $0.89 | $1.50\\* | 69% | $1.52 | 71% |\n\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo! Finance. Fiscal Q4 2026 ended Jan. 25. GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles. \\*Calculation by the author based on the metrics for which management provided guidance.\n\nAs with last quarter, Nvidia's guidance assumed no data center AI chip sales to China.\n\n## Wall Street's estimates for fiscal Q1 guidance\n\nA company's guidance (relative to Wall Street's expectations) will often significantly affect its stock price performance following an earnings release. Sometimes this effect can outweigh the results of the current quarter, because investors are more focused on the future than on the past.\n\nBelow are the analyst consensus estimates for Nvidia's first quarter of fiscal 2027, which will end in late April 2026.\n\n| Metric | Q1 Fiscal 2026 Result | Wall Street's Q1 Fiscal 2027 Consensus Estimate | Wall Street's Projected Growth |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue | $44.06 billion | $70.8 billion | 61% |\n| Adjusted EPS | $0.81 | $1.65 | 104% |\n\nData source: Nvidia and Yahoo! Finance. Fiscal Q1 2027 ends in late April 2026.\n\n![Nvidia Stock Quote](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Fart%2Fcompanylogos%2Fmark%2FNVDA.png&w=128&op=resize)\n\n## [NASDAQ: NVDA](/quote/nasdaq/nvda/)\n\n### Key Data Points\n\n## Nvidia's excellent \"earnings beat\" track record\n\nNvidia has an excellent track record of exceeding Wall Street's earnings estimates, so the probability seems high that it will do so on Feb. 25.\n\nBelow is data for the past 22 quarters, or 5.5 years. I broke out the results of the last four quarters to show the most recent performance. The beats have been smaller more recently, but I attribute that to Nvidia management having greater visibility into future quarters because of its massive backlog of orders. In other words, management can offer better guidance, and Wall Street analysts use it to establish their estimates.\n\n| Period | Earnings\\* Results Relative to Wall Street's Consensus Estimate | Magnitude of Earnings Beat (Average) | Magnitude of Earnings Beat (Range) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Last 22 reported quarters | 20/22 beats = 90.9% | 10%\\*\\* | 3% to 32%\\*\\* |\n| Most recently reported four quarters | 4/4 beats = 100% | 5.2% | 3.5% to 8.5% |\n\n10%\\*\\*\n\n3% to 32%\\*\\*\n\nMost recently reported four quarters\n\nData source: Nvidia and Yahoo! Finance. Calculations by the author. \\*Earnings in the form of adjusted earnings per share (EPS). \\*\\*Rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n## Nvidia stock's post-earnings-release performance\n\nThe data below shows the magnitude of Nvidia's earnings beat and the stock price performance on the day following the release for the prior 11 quarters. I chose 11 for a reason. Nvidia has reported 11 quarters since [generative AI](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/generative-ai/) lit a fire under demand for AI capabilities. Generative AI was introduced to most consumers and business leaders alike when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022.\n\nOf course, it's great for investors to see Nvidia stock pop after its quarterly results are released. But keep in mind that the stock's performance can also depend on factors beyond earnings, such as the market's overall performance and investor sentiment toward AI stocks, which has been quite volatile. Long-term investors should focus more on Nvidia's financial performance and guidance than on the stock's post-earnings-release performance.\n\n| Quarter | Period Ending | Magnitude of Earnings Beat/(Miss)\\* | Stock Price Change Day After Earnings Release |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Q3 fiscal 2026 | Late October 2025 | 3% | (3.2%) |\n| Q2 fiscal 2026 | Late July 2025 | 4% | (0.8%) |\n| Q1 fiscal 2026 | Late April 2025 | 8% | 3.3% |\n| Q4 fiscal 2025 | Late January 2025 | 5% | (8.5%) |\n| Q3 fiscal 2025 | Late October 2024 | 9% | 0.5% |\n| Q2 fiscal 2024 | Late July 2024 | 6% | (6.4%) |\n| Q1 fiscal 2025 | Late April 2024 | 10% | 9.3% |\n| Q4 fiscal 2024 | Late January 2024 | 12% | 16.4% |\n| Q3 fiscal 2024 | Late October 2023 | 19% | (2.5%) |\n| Q2 fiscal 2024 | Late July 2023 | 32% | 0.1% |\n| Q1 fiscal 2024 | Late April 2023 | 18% | 24.4% |\n\n(2.5%)\n\n0.1%\n\n24.4%\n\nData sources: Nvidia, Yahoo! Finance, and YCharts. \\*Rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nAs you can see, there is no significant correlation between the magnitude of the earnings beat and stock price performance after the earnings release.\n\nBut that shouldn't concern long-term investors. As long as Nvidia continues to deliver strong results, its stock price should continue to increase over the long term.\n\n## Read Next\n\n![GettyImages-1456168733-1200x675-128554e](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F856514%2Fgettyimages-1456168733-1200x675-128554e.jpg&w=3840&op=resize)\n![Investor looking at a stock chart with reflection on their glasses](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F856095%2Finvestor-looking-at-a-stock-chart-with-reflection-on-their-glasses.jpg&w=3840&op=resize)\n![GettyImages-519517489 (1)](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F856624%2Fgettyimages-519517489-1.jpg&w=3840&op=resize)\n![AI chip](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F855648%2Fai-chip.jpg&w=3840&op=resize)\n![Nvidia Voyager Headquarters](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F854781%2Fnvidia-voyager-headquarters.jpg&w=3840&op=resize)\n![nvda-stock](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F856656%2Fnvda-stock.jpg&w=3840&op=resize)\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Beth McKenna](https://g.foolcdn.com/avatar/1711700023/large.ashx?_w=3840)\n\n*[Beth McKenna](https://www.fool.com/author/2809/) has positions in Nvidia.

How does the AI marketplace stack up against those metrics? Pretty well. We derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of major publicly traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry knowledge of private players. We estimate that annual revenue from the global AI infrastructure industry -- data center spending, chips, network equipment, storage etc. -- amounted to $600 billion in 2025. We expect that to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when total revenue is forecast to reach $3.0 trillion. Forecasters are making such claims because the market for AI technology is changing rapidly and broadening dramatically. In fact, in the months leading up to Nvidia's latest quarterly results release, the company announced multiple new AI partnership deals -- not with the hyperscalers that dominated earlier GPU demand, but with multiple neoclouds, large global enterprises, and sovereign clients. Indeed, as AI winnings are redeployed into other areas (healthcare, aerospace & defense, financial services), the industries can benefit from operational efficiencies, new products, new markets, and disruptive developments. From an investment standpoint, a market rotation of assets out of purely AI and into potentially beneficiary segments can be healthy for near-term stability in the stock market. The AI trade may be bumpy going forward. But like other transformational technology trades before it (cloud, internet, semiconductors, and PCs), it seems likely to be long and fruitful.\n\n### Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 02/09/2026: Our AI Webinar Series\n\nArgus is hosting a five-part webinar series on Artificial Intelligence (AI), examining how this dynamic force will have an impact across the investing universe.

They cite strong analyst sentiment, ongoing institutional investment, and positive technical trends as reasons for staying optimistic about the company's performance.  \n  \nNvidia has a strong history of surpassing Wall Street’s earnings expectations. Analysts believe this trend is likely to continue during the next earnings release, scheduled for February 25. They also highlight the company’s robust AI ecosystem, high-margin software business, and effective hardware supply control as key strengths.  \n  \nNvidia’s revenue rose 62% in the most recent reported quarter. Looking forward, the company is set to launch new processors in 2026, which could further support its growth. However, some investors are closely watching whether tech companies will continue their current level of spending on AI infrastructure, as this is a key driver of Nvidia's sales.  \n  \nEven if the company beats earnings expectations, it’s important to note that Nvidia’s stock price does not always go up immediately after an earnings release. Market reactions can vary based on other factors, such as future guidance and investor expectations.\n\nNvidia is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings on February 25.\n\nAnalysts highlight the company’s strong earnings history, AI ecosystem, high-margin software, and effective supply control as reasons for their optimism.\n\nNot necessarily.

  "analyzed_articles": "Nvidia Guides to $65B Ahead of Feb. 25 Earnings: Shows AI Demand Is Turning into Real Revenue  \nNVDA | 2026-02-18 | Sources: NVIDIA investor relations, The Motley Fool, Yahoo Finance, AlphaSpread, Investor’s Business Daily\n\nNvidia just put a big, bright number on the table: management is guiding roughly $65 billion for the fiscal quarter that ends in late January, and Wall Street’s consensus sits around $65.6 billion ahead of the company’s Feb. 25 earnings report. That’s not small change — it’s a signal that the surge in AI spending we’ve heard about is moving out of PowerPoint slides and into shipping pallets and invoices. If that guidance holds, it would make the coming report one of the most important corporate snapshots of the AI cycle so far.\n\nThis isn’t an isolated bump. Back in November Nvidia reported record fiscal Q3 revenue of $57.0 billion — up 62% year‑over‑year and 22% sequentially — and CEO Jensen Huang has described demand for the new Blackwell data‑center platform as “off the charts.” At the same time the company has been signing partnerships and deals — an expanded multiyear AI infrastructure pact with Meta and ecosystem moves like Fortanix and NTT DATA working with Nvidia technology on data‑sovereignty and AI factory solutions. Think of Nvidia as the engine and a growing set of big customers as the fuel tank being filled: the engine’s revving, and more organizations are lining up to put their foot on the gas.\n\nThose qualitative signs are backed by hard numbers and market context. Nvidia is now one of the largest companies on the market, and analysts remain broadly bullish heading into earnings — many are reiterating buy ratings and pointing to continued Blackwell ramp and next‑generation processors coming in 2026. Management’s guidance does carry a notable constraint: it assumes no data‑center GPU sales to China, which effectively means growth is being booked without counting a sizable, uncertain market.\n\nKey numbers to keep pinned to your mental bulletin board:\n- Fiscal Q3 revenue (reported Nov. 19, 2025): $57.0 billion (up 62% YoY, up 22% sequentially)  \n- Fiscal Q4 guidance (company): ~$65.0 billion; Wall Street consensus: ~$65.58 billion  \n- Wall Street Q4 EPS estimate: ~$1.52 per share  \n- Market snapshot (from Yahoo Finance): Market cap ≈ $4.44 trillion; trailing P/E ≈ 45.25; forward P/E ≈ 23.75  \n- Trailing 12‑month revenue ≈ $187.14 billion; net income ≈ $99.2 billion; cash ≈ $60.6 billion\n\nWhat this means for a new investor: Nvidia is no longer just a “hot” stock tied to hype — it’s converting massive AI demand into very large revenue streams. Experienced investors will watch whether the Feb. 25 results beat the high bar set by guidance and whether management raises forward guidance — that’s the real acid test. If Nvidia prints numbers close to guidance and reiterates strong demand, the narrative that GPUs and the Blackwell platform are the backbone of enterprise AI spending will get even stronger.\n\nThe catch you should watch: geopolitical and supply dynamics. Management’s guidance explicitly assumes no data‑center AI chip sales to China — meaning a major market remains uncertain and could swing future results if access changes. Also, when a company gets this big, expectations become a fragile thing: even a beat can disappoint if future guidance is conservative. Finally, partnerships and deals (like with Meta) show reach but don’t guarantee sustained margins if competitors or regulatory issues change the landscape. In short: the runway looks long, but keep an eye on China exposure, guidance tone, and whether demand stays “off the charts” once orders translate into shipped units and recurring revenue."
