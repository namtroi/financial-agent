Ron is here to help answer any project-specific questions as he remains involved in the setup of our newer major projects. Before we discuss our results, I will remind everyone that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on management's current assessment of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that our actual results could differ materially. You can find our disclosures about risk factors that could contribute to such differences in our Form 10-Ks, which we filed on February 27, 2025, and in our Form 10-Q that we are filing today.\n\nThe company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements whether due to new information, future events, or otherwise other than as required by law. In addition, during today's call, management will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-financial measures in the earnings release that we issued today and in the Form 10-Q that is being filed today. Both of which can be found in the Investors section of our website. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to Gary Smalley.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Thanks, Jorge. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As I mentioned during our last two earnings calls, it certainly is a great time to be a Tutor Perini shareholder. Our business and correspondingly our stock has performed extremely well this year, yet we are just at the start of what we expect will be a very strong period of double-digit revenue growth, increased profitability, and solid cash generation over the next several years. With what we continue to see on the horizon, there remains tremendous opportunity ahead for further substantial shareholder value creation. Now let's talk about our third-quarter performance. Tutor Perini delivered excellent results for the third quarter, once again setting new records across various key metrics.\n\nOur operating cash flow was extraordinarily strong for the quarter at $289 million and $574 million through the first nine months of 2025, setting new records for both respective periods. The strong cash flow was almost entirely driven by collections from newer and ongoing projects. Our third-quarter cash flow was the second-best for any quarter ever, and our cash flow through the first nine months of this year is already well in excess of last year's full-year record operating cash flow. With what is now our fourth consecutive year of record operating cash generation, the cash on our balance sheet is quite healthy.\n\nWe plan to continue building our cash position until our general corporate purpose cash reaches a level at which we can comfortably initiate one or more strategic capital allocation alternatives, most likely in the form of a recurring dividend and/or a share repurchase program. Tutor Perini has been benefiting from favorable macroeconomic tailwinds which are driving strong sustained market demand for construction services across all segments. We believe that these tailwinds will persist due to the tremendous amount of federal, state, and local level funding that are now in place and because our country has for decades and until recent years neglected to adequately fund and prioritize the types of substantial infrastructure investments being made today.\n\nWe have continued to be successful in capitalizing on major project opportunities, adding $2 billion of new awards and contract adjustments in the third quarter, which increased our backlog to a new record of $21.6 billion, up 54% year over year. Backlog for both the Building and Specialty Contractors segments also set new records. Our book-to-burn ratio for the third quarter was 1.4x. I'll provide further details on some of our new awards shortly.\n\nOur third-quarter revenue was strong, up 31% year over year, and revenue for the first nine months of 2025 was the highest since 2009, achieving record quarterly and first nine months revenue performance for the Civil segment and the best performance since 2020 for the Building segment. Operating income was up significantly this quarter despite a further substantial increase in our share-based compensation expense that resulted from the dramatic growth in our stock price, which has nearly tripled since the end of last year, reflecting our continued strong operating performance driven by contributions from various newer higher-margin projects in the civil and building segments.\n\nI will note that while we expect our share-based compensation expense to be higher than previously anticipated for the full year of 2025, it is still projected to decrease considerably in 2026 and further in 2027 once certain awards have vested. The Civil segment continues to perform at record levels, delivering its highest segment operating income ever for both the third quarter and first nine months of the year, with strong margins that are sustainably above the historical range for the segment. The Building segment's operating income for the first nine months of 2025 was the highest since 2011. And importantly, the Specialty Contractors segment returned to profitability this quarter ahead of expectations.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share for the third quarter, which excludes the impact of share-based compensation expense, net of the associated tax benefit, was $1.15, up significantly compared to the adjusted loss per share of $1.61 reported for the third quarter last year, again demonstrating our strong core operating performance and contributions from various newer larger and higher-margin projects, many of which are just ramping up. Our GAAP EPS was $0.07 for the third quarter, a substantial improvement compared to a loss of $1.92 per share for the same quarter last year. Overall, our business continues to perform extremely well this year, significantly better than we anticipated at the start of the year.\n\nThe newer larger projects I mentioned are expected to drive very substantial growth, strong profitability, and solid cash flow over the next several years. Now taking a closer look at our new awards in the third quarter, the largest of these included the UCSF Benioff New Children's Hospital in California valued at approximately $1 billion, a $182 million defense system project in Guam, and a $155 million education facility project in California. We also listed several other smaller new awards in our earnings release today.\n\nLooking ahead, we believe that our backlog will remain strong as we continue to see numerous major bidding opportunities for our civil and building segments, many of which should also include a significant role for our electrical and mechanical business units within the Specialty Contractors segment. Our most significant new project opportunities over the next several years are primarily located in California, New York, the Midwest, and the Indo-Pacific region. Among these opportunities are several building segment projects currently in the preconstruction phase that are expected to advance to the construction phase, a few later this year and others over the next two years. We have well over $25 billion of upcoming bidding opportunities over the twelve to eighteen months.\n\nThe largest of which include the $12 billion Sepulveda Transit Corridor, the $3.8 billion Southeast Gateway Line, and a $2 billion replacement hospital, all of which are in California. As well as the $5 billion Penn Station transformation project in New York, the $1.4 billion I-35 Platnik Bridge project in Minnesota, and the $1 billion I-69 ORX Section 2 project connecting Indiana and Kentucky. In addition to these billion-dollar-plus projects, we have an even firmer opportunity that is on the near-term horizon. We expect to add approximately $1 billion to backlog by the second quarter of next year for the finished trade scope of work for phase one of the Midtown Bus Terminal in New York City.\n\nRecall that we were awarded the first part of phase one of the bus terminal project last quarter for an announced value of $1.87 billion. We also continue to have significant Indo-Pacific opportunities largely driven by the federal government's Pacific Deterrence Initiative. Black Construction, our Guam-based subsidiary, has had tremendous success in winning various new projects throughout the region and continues to be well-positioned to capture additional major projects over the coming years. We remain highly selective as to what opportunities we will pursue, with a continued focus on bidding projects with favorable contractual terms, limited competition, and higher margins.\n\nWe are pursuing projects that will highlight Tutor Perini's differentiated approach, depth of operational talent, and history of outstanding project execution. Based on our outstanding performance to date and strong confidence in the results we expect to deliver for the fourth quarter, we are raising our guidance for the third consecutive quarter. Our adjusted EPS for 2025 is now expected to be in the range of $4 to $4.20, up from our previous guidance of $3.65 to $3.95. Importantly, the outlook for Tutor Perini remains very positive beyond 2025.\n\nWe still anticipate that our adjusted EPS in 2026 and 2027 will be significantly higher than the upper end of our increased guidance for 2025, and we expect strong operating cash flow for the rest of this year and beyond. Finally, I will reiterate and expand a bit on what we have said earlier this year regarding the broader macro environment. We still do not anticipate that tariffs will have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe also do not currently foresee the risk of any of our major projects in backlog being canceled, delayed, defunded, or otherwise materially impacted by the administration's targeted funding cuts or by the recent federal government shutdown, including our work on the first phase of the California High-Speed Rail project or any of our projects in New York. We have had discussions with our customers, and they have confirmed that our projects are funded and authorized and they are not expected to be adversely impacted. So for us, it continues to be business as usual at this time on all of our major projects. Thank you.\n\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Ryan to discuss the details of our third-quarter results.\n\n**Ryan Soroka:** Thanks, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a discussion of our third-quarter results, after which I'll provide some commentary on our balance sheet and our latest 2025 guidance assumptions. All comparative references will be against the same quarter of last year unless otherwise stated. Revenue for 2025 was $1.42 billion, up 31% year over year. Civil segment revenue was $770 million, up 41%. Building segment revenue was $419 million, down slightly compared to last year, but expected to increase substantially over the coming quarters. Specialty Contractors segment revenue was $226 million, up a very strong 124%.\n\nOur revenue growth for this quarter continued to be driven by increased project execution activities on various newer, larger, and higher-margin projects that all have substantial scope of work remaining. These included the Midtown Bus Terminal Phase One project in New York, a new hospital project in California, the Brooklyn and Manhattan Jails, The Honolulu Rail project, the Manhattan Tunnel, the Newark AirTrain replacement, and the Kensco ECU Connection Tunnel. All of these projects are in their early stages and are expected to ramp up substantially over the next several years. Civil segment income from construction operations was $99 million in 2025, up substantially compared to a loss of $13 million last year.\n\nLast year's third-quarter loss was due to a significant charge that resulted from an adverse arbitration decision on a completed bridge project in California, which we are appealing. The improvement this quarter was otherwise driven by contributions related to the strong revenue growth from higher-margin projects that I mentioned for the segment. Civil segment operating margin was solid at 12.9% for 2025 and 15.1% through 2025, both well ahead of the segment's historical 8% to 12% range and in line with our expectations for 13% to 15% for this year.\n\nBuilding segment income from construction operations was $14 million in the third quarter, also up considerably compared to a loss of $4 million last year, which was mostly due to a charge we took during last year's third quarter for the settlement of a legacy dispute on a completed government facility project in Florida. The profit increase in the current year quarter was primarily due to contributions related to the increased project execution activities I mentioned. Building segment operating margin was 3.4% for 2025, in line with expectations. We believe this margin will continue to increase over the next several quarters as volume from certain higher-margin projects grows.\n\nSpecialty Contractors segment income from construction operations was $6 million for the third quarter, reflecting an earlier than anticipated return to profitability and compares to a loss of $57 million last year. The improvement was primarily due to the absence of certain prior year unfavorable adjustments as well as the current year contributions related to the segment's very strong revenue growth, with increased project execution activities on various newer projects across diverse end markets. Other income for the third quarter was $7 million compared to $4 million last year. Interest expense was $14 million, down 36% compared to $21 million last year because of our significant debt reduction since last year.\n\nIncome tax expense for the third quarter was $15 million with a corresponding effective tax rate of 44.6%, compared to an income tax benefit of $34 million last year, with a corresponding effective tax rate of 27.5%. We trued up our tax provision again this quarter, and our new projected effective tax rate for 2025 is now higher than previously anticipated, entirely due to the significant increase in share-based compensation expense that Gary mentioned and the fact that nearly all of that higher expense is non-deductible.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Tutor Perini for 2025 was $4 million or $0.07 of earnings per share, a result impacted by the further increase in our share-based compensation expense but still a substantial improvement compared to the net loss attributable to Tutor Perini of $101 million or $1.92 loss per share in last year's third quarter. Adjusted net income attributable to Tutor Perini was $62 million or $1.15 of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter, up very substantially compared to an adjusted net loss attributable to Tutor Perini of $85 million and an adjusted loss of $1.61 per share for last year's third quarter.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2025, adjusted net income attributable to Tutor Perini was $171 million or $3.22 of adjusted earnings per share, also up very meaningfully compared to an adjusted net loss attributable to Tutor Perini of $46 million or an adjusted loss of $0.88 per share for the same period last year. As you can tell, our business is performing well with core operations performance driving very solid earnings this year, and reflecting a dramatic turnaround compared to last year. As Gary mentioned, our operating cash flows for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 were record-breaking at $289 million and $574 million, respectively.\n\nWe expect that our operating cash for the full year of 2025 will shatter last year's record and will represent our fourth straight year of record cash generation. We also anticipate our cash flows will continue to be strong well beyond 2025, driven by organic cash collections, that is from new and existing projects and occasionally enhanced by collections associated with dispute resolutions. Next, I'll address our balance sheet. Our total debt at September 30, 2025, was $413 million, down 23% compared to $534 million at the end of 2024. Our cash balance has grown substantially this quarter due to our record operating cash flow, and it continues to significantly exceed our total debt, now by $283 million.\n\nOur cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings, or CIE, declined again this quarter and is at the lowest level it has been since 2017. CIE has declined by $95 million or 10% since the end of last year, mostly driven by the resolution, billing, and collection of various disputed matters, as opposed to project charges. Our CIE is expected to continue to decrease as we resolve the remaining legacy disputes. Finally, here are our latest updated assumptions regarding our increased earnings guidance.\n\nG&A expense for 2025 is now expected to be between $410 million and $420 million, with the increase from our previous assumption due entirely to increased share-based compensation expense as our share price has continued to climb. Depreciation and amortization expense is now anticipated to be approximately $50 million in 2025, with depreciation at $48 million and amortization at $2 million. Interest expense for 2025 is still expected to be approximately $55 million, of which about $5 million will be non-cash. This is $34 million or 38% lower than our interest expense of $89 million in 2024.\n\nOur effective income tax rate for 2025 is now expected to be approximately 30% to 32%, higher than previously anticipated due to the increase in share-based compensation expense, nearly all of which is non-deductible. We still anticipate non-controlling interest to be between $75 million and $85 million, significantly higher than last year due to increased contributions from certain joint ventures. We still expect approximately 53 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2025. And capital expenditures are now anticipated to be approximately $170 million to $180 million, with the vast majority of the CapEx in 2025 estimated at approximately $120 million to $130 million to meet owner-funded large equipment items on certain large new projects such as tunnel boring machines.\n\nThank you. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Gary.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Thank you, Ryan. In summary, we delivered extraordinary results for the third quarter that exceeded expectations. Record operating cash flow, continued strong revenue growth, solid operating income and profitability across all segments, and strong bottom-line earnings, as well as backlog that climbed to a new all-time record of $21.6 billion. This record backlog should enable us to produce strong double-digit revenue growth and significantly higher earnings in 2026 and 2027, while serving as a catalyst for continued strong annual cash flow as our newer projects progress through design and into construction.\n\nOur excellent performance to date combined with our confidence in the results we expect to deliver for the fourth quarter has enabled us to raise our 2025 EPS guidance for the third consecutive quarter. The outlook for Tutor Perini is very bright over the next several years as we continue to benefit from favorable macroeconomic tailwinds and strong public and private customer funding that are fueling sustained market demand for our services. Finally, and just to reiterate, despite the dramatic growth we have seen this year in our stock price, I still believe we have tremendous opportunity ahead for further substantial shareholder value creation. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.\n\n**Operator:** Thank you. With that, we will now be conducting a question and answer session. And our first question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis and Company. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Adam Thalhimer:** Hey, good afternoon, guys. Great quarter.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Thanks, Adam.\n\n**Adam Thalhimer:** Can you give a little more color on specialty turning positive? What drove that? And what's your expectation for the next few quarters?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yeah, Adam. Look, what's really driving specialty performance is the work that we have, the non-claim resolution or dispute resolution work is just going extremely well. We're making a heck of a lot of money. The work that we're primarily doing is for Tutor Perini, but also the work that we're not doing for Tutor Perini is just doing extremely well. So we have a quarter that had very little noise from, you know, dispute resolutions, and that's what's really driving it. So whenever we have quarters like that throughout the business, but especially for specialty at this point, you're going to see much-improved results.\n\n**Adam Thalhimer:** Does the specialty revenue trend up from the Q3 level?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yes. It will because, you know, keep in mind that most of the work that they're doing is for these larger projects that we've been announcing awards of over the last year and a half or so. And as those projects continue to ramp up, their participation will continue to ramp up. So their revenue is going to go up significantly, particularly New York-based revenue.\n\n**Adam Thalhimer:** And then can you just level set us lastly on how many of the legacy disputes are remaining?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yeah. You know, we're looking at about a dozen, let's say, of any significance. You know, there's some cats and dogs, odds and ends out there too, but ten to twelve of any significance.\n\n**Adam Thalhimer:** Great. Nice job. Thank you.\n\n**Operator:** And our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Liam Burke:** Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Hi, Liam.\n\n**Liam Burke:** Hi, Gary. As you move on with better terms and better margins on these contracts, the rolling over as we can see in your operating margins, is your bidding activity staying robust or have you been seeing less interest in certain areas?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** No. It's still very robust. We've got a load of work that's coming up in different geographies really led by New York still. And a lot of things happening in California. We still have Indo-Pacific that's looking very strong as well as the Midwest. So in all of our major geographies, there's still a really strong pipeline of work yet to be bid.\n\n**Liam Burke:** Great. And I don't want to keep harping on specialty contractors, but you had a pretty nice quarter in awards. The announcements, which we really don't hear a lot about. Is there something changing in terms of the amount of awards that specialty contractors are getting?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Not really. Just keep in mind though for these larger projects, particularly in New York that we've been announcing, their participation is very strong in each one of those projects. So that means that as the backlog was building for the whole company, the specialty backlog, particularly in New York, has also been building. And this is higher margin work for them than what they've seen in the past. So expect higher margins to be reported as we move forward.\n\n**Liam Burke:** Great. Thank you, Gary.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yeah. Thank you.\n\n**Operator:** Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Min Cho with Texas Capital Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Min Cho:** Alright. Thank you. Congratulations on another strong quarter and guidance raise.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Thank you, Min.\n\n**Min Cho:** So you went through your $12 billion kind of near-term bid pipeline pretty quickly. I know the awards and backlog can be kind of lumpy from time to time, but based on that pipeline, and just the timing of the pipeline, could you exit the fourth quarter at another record? Or are we expecting something a little bit more flattish?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yeah. It's probably a little bit more flattish in the fourth quarter. It's going to be lumpier. You know, lately, it's been every quarter seems, you know, increased new record, new record, new record. And we're not gonna see that going forward in the short term. We may have new records, but it won't be consistently quarter after quarter. So a little bit lumpy, but flattish over the short term, short to medium term anyway.\n\n**Min Cho:** Right. It's still just a very high level. So that's great. Also, kind of going back and maybe, Ryan, on the specialty contracting business. Nice to see it back in the black. By 2026, could you kind of be at your target of 5% to 8%? Or given what's in the pipeline, do you expect that could take a little bit longer?\n\n**Ryan Soroka:** Yeah. I think there's certainly potential to get up to that 5% to 8%. In particular, looking forward as these newer projects ramp up and that are obviously coming along with the significant civil work and building work. So I think as those revenues and margins come through, I think you're going to see those margins continue to elevate.\n\n**Min Cho:** Excellent. And then just finally, Gary, obviously, directional outlook for 2026 is still to be up substantially from 2025. But from even the last quarter, are you feeling better or the same about 2026? And if you can just talk about what's maybe changed.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yeah. I would say at least as good, if not better. What's happening is we continue to have exceptional results in resolving the things of the past. And, you know, so that certainly is helpful. But also as we go forward, you know, we're seeing more clarity in the work that we were booking. We've been able to do a better job negotiating what we call buyouts. So in other words, we often load risk to vendors and subcontractors, and for these lump sum projects, we've done a better job than what we thought. So everything is and then the early performance is also really better than what we thought.\n\nSo I would say that, you know, we expect we just are more bullish now over 2026 and even 2027 than we were before. But it's always been, you know, very high expectations, and so we still have those, with a little bit more.\n\n**Min Cho:** Great. Thank you so much and good luck.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Alright. Thank you, Min.\n\n**Operator:** Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Michael Dennis with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Michael Dennis:** Good afternoon, gentlemen.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Hi, Mike.\n\n**Michael Dennis:** Hi. Not sure who's had a better year, the Padres or Dodgers.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** That's a good question.\n\n**Michael Dennis:** You could ponder that offline. Gary, we've talked a couple of responses to the questions about the bookings that you're looking at and the bidding activity. There's several, and they're large. How do you look at that relative to, like, where your business is today? What regions? Your capacity, the ability to kind of continue to execute at this high level? And is this is the market set up for maybe not in the next few quarters, but maybe the next twelve to thirty months to have another uptick in what the backlog can be and what the can be out, say, to the end of the decade?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yeah. It certainly can have an uptick as we progress through these bids. It really depends on the timing of when the bids come to fruition and then, of course, our success rate. But there's some large projects that you've heard. We like our chances. As far as capacity, we're not going to overextend ourselves. We're very disciplined in the approach. We still have capacity for more, but we also are working off projects too. So as projects, you know, get worked off, we have staff that become available, and we insert those individuals, those key leaders where we need them most.\n\nSo we feel really good about where we're staffed, and we feel good about what the long-term prospects of this backlog can look like.\n\n**Michael Dennis:** Appreciate that. And then my follow-up is Gary, I mean, the cash performance has been outstanding. It goes without saying. Maybe as we think about it, you're gonna need some cash to grow the business, I'm assuming, you know, as these projects wrap up in the cash cycle. And you did mention about what to do once you get to this certain level on cash. Maybe you could share a little bit about what you're thinking, maybe the Board might be thinking internally on this concept. And, you know, over how much more, what kind of level is required to start thinking about that in a more tangible thought process?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** I won't give you an exact timeline, but I will say that it is a topic of conversation every time we get together with the board, and the next time is next week. And I think that we're unanimous in believing up until the latest conversations is that it would be prudent to continue to accumulate more cash because of exactly what you said. We still have to look at future needs for the cash. So we'll be conservative. We'll be intelligent with what we do. And as far as the timing, I won't have a spoiler alert at this point because we got to get through the meeting next week.\n\nAnd then we'll, if there are any news, then we'll roll it out as soon as possible. But look for continued conservatism and just caution to make sure that we have excess cash rather than needing to draw down on some revolver or anything.\n\n**Michael Dennis:** That makes perfect sense. So just a quick follow-up on my on the bidding opportunities. Are you bidding on those by yourself, or are there any joint venture partners? And so many of these I'm assuming you're most of them gonna be on your own or is there some you might join with some partners?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yeah. It's a mix. You know, when the projects get as large as the ones that we were talking about, it's likely that there's a JV partner. But look, we do very well with respect to surety support being able to deliver projects ourselves without the need for others to participate. We also have capabilities internally that we don't always need help. But these are huge programs, so look for we'll say a good many of those to have a JV. And then we'll rely on our experience with our JV partners in the past. We've always had very successful JVs and would look to go back to our established partners.\n\n**Michael Dennis:** Thank you, Gary.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Thank you.\n\n**Operator:** And our final question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Steven Fisher:** Thanks. Good afternoon. Congratulations also on the cash generation there. Just curious on that point. What's the outlook for sort of the mobilization payments or upfront payments that you're getting? Is that now mostly kind of happened as your sort of backlog is flattening before this next wave? And is cash going forward for the next handful of quarters going to be more red, it's just sort of ongoing project burn?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yeah, most of the mobilization payments have happened. There's still a couple of fragments to go. I would look at cash to continue to be strong. Not as strong as what we had in the third quarter. That's just really phenomenal, the $289 million. So it'll still be very strong compared to where we've been historically. And we'd look for continued strong cash going into 2026 and 2027 and beyond that too.\n\n**Steven Fisher:** Okay. That's helpful. And just in terms of impactful margin momentum, I mean, clearly going especially from negative to positive is important, but on the scale of dollars, it's maybe not as big as what could happen with the building segment. So just trying to get a sense of both the timing and the magnitude of that momentum on the building side.\n\nAnd so maybe you can help me with this in terms of as we think about the revenue mix of the building segment over the next couple of years, what percent of that do you think is going to be sort of the typical lower margin GC work with a lot of the subcontractor pass-throughs versus the larger imprison type projects where you've got more a higher margin profile. Is this going to be you think fifty-fifty within that segment? Or more weighted towards those kind of fixed price projects like the prison type thing?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Look, as always, our margin profile is dependent on a large mix of work. A good bit of the work that we're doing now is the you mentioned the prisons, it's work like that is higher margin. Even the traditionally lower margin work that we're doing now, some of those projects are showing increased margins too. So without giving you an exact percent, the mix is better than it's ever been. Certainly, the fixed price work impacts that, but also the complexity of some of the work that we're doing and the absence of bidders not even talking about, you know, the fixed price work, that's helping us to demand higher margin there too.\n\nSo that's why we're so bullish on building margins being improving because the content of this newer work that's higher margin is just going to feed the margin growth in the building segment.\n\n**Steven Fisher:** Makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up there is when do you think you'll hit the point where the Building segment margins are really reflecting the solid burn on all the work that's gone in there. Is that sort of a 2027 timeframe? Or could it be sometime before then?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** No. I think you're gonna see by mid-2026, you're gonna see a significant impact and it's going to be improved by the time you get to 2027. But 2026, I think, I mean, the latter part of 2026 is going to look much better than where we are even now with the elevated margins in 2025.\n\n**Steven Fisher:** Okay. And then I guess the last question here. Suppose I have to ask on the government funding side. You mentioned, Gary, that the government shutdown and the budget cuts aren't going to have an impact. I guess I'm curious to hear what you think about the dynamics with the Mayor-elect in New York City here versus the Trump administration and what that could mean for ongoing projects and perhaps, importantly, something, you know, like Port Authority, you know, which you have, it sounds like another slug coming. So what do you think about those dynamics and how they could play out?\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Yeah. Look, you know, it's hard to predict what the future might hold, but we're not expecting any, you know, significant impacts. And you mentioned the Port Authority. Look, the Port Authority is not a city agency. It's, you know, it's a state agency between two states, New Jersey and New York. And we don't we just don't anticipate any impacts and nor do our owners, our customers. We're having active dialogue with them as developments occur. And so far, we don't see any impact at all.\n\n**Steven Fisher:** Okay. Terrific.\n\n**Operator:** Thank you. And with that, that does conclude the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Gary Smalley for closing remarks.\n\n**Gary Smalley:** Thank you, everyone, again for your interest and participation today. We look forward to continuing to deliver strong results going forward as we have for the first three quarters of this year. Look, we appreciate your support and confidence in the progress that we are making and your patience for those of you who have been with us for a long time. For those of you who have been in wait-and-see mode, you know, that's okay. I get it. But we believe that there's still a lot more good to come, so get on board. There's still time. And look, we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator:** Thank you. With that, this concludes today's teleconference.

The Company experienced solid year-over-year growth across all three segments, primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain newer, higher-margin projects, all of which have significant scope of work remaining. Civil and Building segment revenues for the second quarter of 2025 were up 34% and 11%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year. The Civil segment's revenue for both the second quarter and first six months of 2025 were the segment's highest ever for the respective periods.\n\nIncome from construction operations for the second quarter of 2025 was $76.4 million, up 89% compared to $40.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was principally due to higher-margin contributions related to the increased project execution activities discussed above. The Company's income from construction operations for the second quarter of 2025 was negatively impacted by a $38.5 million ($0.71 per diluted share) increase in share-based compensation expense compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to the doubling of the Company’s stock price during the second quarter of 2025, which affected the fair value of certain liability-classified awards. Net income attributable to the Company for the second quarter of 2025 was $20.0 million, or EPS of $0.38, up substantially compared to $0.8 million, or EPS of $0.02, for the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted net income attributable to the Company, which excludes the impact of share-based compensation expense, net of associated tax benefit, for the second quarter of 2025 was $75.1 million, or $1.41 of Adjusted EPS, compared to $17.5 million, or $0.34 of Adjusted EPS, for the second quarter of 2024. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for further information and a reconciliation of the Company's financial results reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) to the reported adjusted results.\n\nThe Company generated $262.4 million of cash from operating activities in the second quarter of 2025 and $285.3 million in the first six months of 2025, both of which set new records for each respective period, and both up significantly compared to $53.1 million and $151.4 million for the same periods last year. The Company's operating cash flow result for the second quarter of 2025 was the second-highest result of any quarter. The record operating cash flow for the first half of 2025 was driven largely by collections from newer and ongoing projects and, to a much lesser extent, from collections related to recent dispute resolutions. The Company expects continued strong operating cash flow for the remainder of 2025.\n\n**Record Backlog**\n\nThe Company booked $3.1 billion of new awards and contract adjustments in the second quarter of 2025, reflecting its continued success in capturing significant new project opportunities resulting from a combination of its strategic bidding approach and favorable market dynamics, including limited competition in select markets for some of the larger projects. This environment, which is supported by strong public funding and demand, has allowed the Company to differentiate itself and deliver compelling proposals that align with the customer's goals and expectations. As a result of the strong new awards activity, the Company's backlog grew to a new record of $21.1 billion as of June 30, 2025, up 102% compared to the backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2024 and up 9% compared to the previous record backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2025. Backlog for the Civil and Specialty Contractors segments as of June 30, 2025 also set new records. The most significant new awards and contract adjustments in the second quarter of 2025 included:\n\nThe Company expects its backlog will remain strong in 2025 due in part to several Building segment projects currently in the preconstruction phase that are anticipated to advance to the construction phase later this year. In addition, Tutor Perini expects to continue bidding selectively on various project opportunities this year that will drive long-term shareholder value. The Company continues to have numerous major project bidding opportunities, particularly on the West Coast, in the Midwest, and in the Indo-Pacific region, and is well positioned to continue winning its share of new projects this year and over the next several years.\n\n**Significant Balance Sheet Improvements**\n\nThe Company has continued to make significant strides in improving its balance sheet. Total debt as of June 30, 2025 was $419 million, down 21% compared to $534 million at the end of 2024. As a result of the very strong cash collections in the second quarter of 2025, the Company's cash exceeded its total debt by $107 million as of June 30, 2025, and it was the first time since 2010 that cash was greater than total debt. In addition, the Company's balance of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings (\"CIE\") was $856 million as of June 30, 2025, down $91 million (or 10%) compared to the balance at the end of the first quarter of 2025 and at the lowest level it has been since the second quarter of 2017. This reduction in CIE was primarily driven by the resolution and billing of various previously disputed matters.\n\n**Management Remarks**\n\nGary Smalley, Tutor Perini's Chief Executive Officer and President, remarked, \"Our second-quarter results were exceptional across all key metrics and reflect our continued outstanding operating performance and significant business momentum. Our strong revenue growth and profitability is being driven by our record backlog, which has continued to grow and includes various larger long-duration and higher-margin projects, most of which are in the early stages. We are confident that our record backlog will continue to drive higher revenue and strong profitability over the rest of 2025 and even more so in 2026 and 2027, as our newer projects advance to construction. Our operating cash flow for the first six months of 2025 was our highest first-half result ever, and we expect strong earnings and cash flow to continue through the rest of this year and beyond. Our earnings to date are considerably higher than expected, raising our confidence in Tutor Perini's outlook, as demonstrated by a second consecutive quarter of increased earnings guidance. We believe that our growth and earnings momentum remains poised to continue over the next several years.\"\n\n**Outlook and Guidance**\n\nTutor Perini's business has performed extremely well through the first half of 2025, and the Company anticipates continued strong operating performance and financial results over the rest of this year, with significantly higher revenue and earnings still expected in 2026 and 2027 as various newer large projects advance to the construction phase.\n\nBased on the Company's outstanding year-to-date results in 2025 and management's increased confidence in its performance trajectory for the remainder of the year, the Company is now providing 2025 GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $1.70 to $2.00, up from $1.60 to $1.95, with corresponding 2025 Adjusted EPS expected in the range of $3.65 to $3.95, a significant increase compared to what would have been the prior Adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.45 to $2.80 had the Company provided Adjusted EPS guidance previously. The Company's increased guidance continues to factor in a significant amount of contingency for various unknown or unexpected outcomes and developments in 2025. Based on its current projections, the Company expects that both GAAP EPS and Adjusted EPS for 2026 and 2027 will be higher than the upper end of its increased 2025 guidance.\n\nThe Company continues to see strong demand for its services, driven by well-funded state, local and federal customers that have numerous large-scale, high-priority infrastructure projects planned over the next several years, as well as by certain commercial customers that continue to advance projects for new or renovated buildings in end markets such as healthcare, education, and hospitality and gaming.\n\nAlthough share-based compensation expense increased substantially in the second quarter of 2025 due to the dramatic increase in the Company's share price, as discussed above, and it is expected to be higher than previously anticipated for the full year of 2025, the Company expects that share-based compensation expense will decrease considerably in 2026 and further in 2027 once certain liability-classified awards have vested. Because of the substantial increase in share-based compensation expense this year and the significant impact that it has had and will continue to have through the end of 2026 on the Company's reported GAAP financial results, the Company is also reporting certain financial results on an adjusted basis, as described below.\n\nTutor Perini still does not currently anticipate any significant impact from recently imposed tariffs or the curtailment of federal funding programs but continues to closely monitor these issues.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented under GAAP, we are presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional insights that facilitate the comparison of our past and present performance, and they are among the indicators management uses to assess the Company’s financial performance and to forecast future performance. By including these non-GAAP financial measures, we aim to provide investors and stakeholders a clearer understanding of our operating results and enhance transparency with respect to the key financial metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude share-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 (as well as the tax benefit associated with the expense), include adjusted net income attributable to the Company and adjusted earnings per share. We exclude share-based compensation expense because this expense could result in significant volatility in our reported earnings, driven primarily by fluctuations in the expense recognized for certain long-term incentive compensation awards with payouts that are indexed to the Company’s common stock. By adjusting for share-based compensation, our non-GAAP measures present a supplemental depiction of our operational performance and financial health. This approach allows stakeholders to focus on our core operational efficiency and profitability without the variable impact to earnings caused by significant changes in our stock price. Our non-GAAP measures are intended to offer a consistent basis for evaluating the Company’s performance, which management believes is meaningful to stakeholders.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release as calculated by the Company are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\n\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures and guidance are found in the tables below:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n|  |  | **Three Months Ended  June 30,** | | | | | | |  | **Six Months Ended  June 30,** | | | | | | |\n| *(in millions, except per common share amounts)* |  | **2025** | | |  | **2024** | | |  | **2025** | | |  | **2024** | | |\n| Net income attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation, as reported |  | $ | 20.0 |  |  | $ | 0.8 |  |  | $ | 48.0 |  |  | $ | 16.6 |  |\n| Plus: Share-based compensation expense(a) |  |  | 55.4 |  |  |  | 16.9 |  |  |  | 62.0 |  |  |  | 22.4 |  |\n| Less: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense |  |  | (0.3 | ) |  |  | (0.2 | ) |  |  | (0.5 | ) |  |  | (0.3 | ) |\n| Adjusted net income attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation |  | $ | 75.1 |  |  | $ | 17.5 |  |  | $ | 109.5 |  |  | $ | 38.7 |  |\n|  |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| EPS, as reported |  | $ | 0.38 |  |  | $ | 0.02 |  |  | $ | 0.90 |  |  | $ | 0.31 |  |\n| Plus: Share-based compensation expense impact per diluted share |  |  | 1.04 |  |  |  | 0.32 |  |  |  | 1.17 |  |  |  | 0.43 |  |\n| Less: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense per diluted share |  |  | (0.01 | ) |  |  | (0.00 | ) |  |  | (0.01 | ) |  |  | (0.01 | ) |\n| Adjusted EPS |  | $ | 1.41 |  |  | $ | 0.34 |  |  | $ | 2.06 |  |  | $ | 0.73 |  |\n\n**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n**Three Months Ended\n  \nJune 30,**\n\n**Six Months Ended\n  \nJune 30,**\n\n*(in millions, except per common share amounts)*\n\n**2025**\n\n**2024**\n\n**2025**\n\n**2024**\n\nNet income attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation, as reported\n\n$\n\n20.0\n\n$\n\n0.8\n\n$\n\n48.0\n\n$\n\n16.6\n\nPlus: Share-based compensation expense(a)\n\n55.4\n\n16.9\n\n62.0\n\n22.4\n\nLess: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense\n\n(0.3\n\n)\n\n(0.2\n\n)\n\n(0.5\n\n)\n\n(0.3\n\n)\n\nAdjusted net income attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation\n\n$\n\n75.1\n\n$\n\n17.5\n\n$\n\n109.5\n\n$\n\n38.7\n\nEPS, as reported\n\n$\n\n0.38\n\n$\n\n0.02\n\n$\n\n0.90\n\n$\n\n0.31\n\nPlus: Share-based compensation expense impact per diluted share\n\n1.04\n\n0.32\n\n1.17\n\n0.43\n\nLess: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense per diluted share\n\n(0.01\n\n)\n\n(0.00\n\n)\n\n(0.01\n\n)\n\n(0.01\n\n)\n\nAdjusted EPS\n\n$\n\n1.41\n\n$\n\n0.34\n\n$\n\n2.06\n\n$\n\n0.73\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ | | |\n| (a) |  | The amount represents share-based compensation expense recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.

These forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential impacts on the Company. While the Company’s expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and the Company believes there is a reasonable basis for them, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the control of the Company) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: unfavorable outcomes of existing or future litigation or dispute resolution proceedings against us or customers (project owners, developers, general contractors, etc.), subcontractors or suppliers, as well as failure to promptly recover significant working capital invested in projects subject to such matters; revisions of estimates of contract risks, revenue or costs; economic factors such as inflation, tariffs, the timing of new awards, or the pace of project execution, which have resulted and may continue to result in losses or lower than anticipated profit; contract requirements to perform extra work beyond the initial project scope, which has and in the future could result in disputes or claims and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows; risks and other uncertainties associated with estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements; an inability to obtain bonding could have a negative impact on our operations and results; a significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions, such as those presented during a recession; failure to meet contractual schedule requirements, which could result in higher costs and reduced profits or, in some cases, exposure to financial liability for liquidated damages and/or damages to customers, as well as damage to our reputation; inability to attract and retain our key officers, and to adequately plan for their succession, and hire and retain personnel required to execute and perform on our contracts; decreases in the level of federal, state and local government spending for infrastructure and other public projects; possible systems and information technology interruptions and breaches in data security and/or privacy; the impact of inclement weather conditions, disasters and other catastrophic events outside of our control on projects; risks related to our international operations, such as uncertainty of U.S. government funding, as well as economic, political, regulatory and other risks, including risks of loss due to acts of war, labor conditions, and other unforeseeable events in countries where we do business, which could adversely affect our revenue and earnings; client cancellations of, delays in, or reductions in scope under contracts reported in our backlog, as well as prospective project opportunities, including as a result of potential impacts from recently implemented tariffs or other government-related mandates; increased competition and failure to secure new contracts; risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations; failure of our joint venture partners to perform their venture obligations, which could impose additional financial and performance obligations on us, resulting in reduced profits or losses and/or reputational harm; violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws; significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders and potentially subject us to securities litigation; failure to meet our obligations under our debt agreements (especially in a high interest rate environment); downgrades in our credit ratings; public health crises, such as COVID-19, have adversely impacted, and could in the future adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operations by, among other things, delaying the timing of project bids and/or awards and the timing of dispute resolutions and associated collections; physical and regulatory risks related to climate change; impairment of our goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets; the exertion of influence over the Company by our executive chairman due to his position and significant ownership interests; and other risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed on February 27, 2025 and in other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.*\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Tutor

The Company delivered solid year-over-year growth across all three segments through the first nine months of 2025, primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain newer, larger and higher-margin projects, all of which have significant scope of work remaining.\n\nRevenue for the Civil and Specialty Contractors segments for the third quarter of 2025 was up 41% and 124%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year. The Civil segment's revenue for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 were the segment's highest ever for the respective periods, as market demand for construction projects remains strong and the Company continues to capitalize on major bidding opportunities.\n\nIncome from construction operations for the third quarter of 2025 was $40.1 million, up significantly compared to a loss from construction operations of $106.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase was principally due to higher-margin contributions related to the increased project execution activities discussed above, as well as the absence of certain net unfavorable adjustments that impacted results for the third quarter of 2024. The Company's income from construction operations for the third quarter of 2025 reflected a $42.2 million ($0.77 per diluted share) increase in share-based compensation expense compared to the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to continued growth in the Company’s stock price, which was up 171% year-to-date through the end of the third quarter of 2025, affecting the fair value of liability-classified awards.\n\nNet income attributable to the Company for the third quarter of 2025 was $3.6 million, or EPS of $0.07, up substantially compared to net loss attributable to the Company of $100.9 million, or a $1.92 diluted loss per share, for the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted net income attributable to the Company, which excludes the impact of share-based compensation expense, net of associated tax benefit, for the third quarter of 2025 was $61.9 million, or $1.15 of Adjusted EPS, compared to Adjusted net loss attributable to the Company, which also excludes the impact of share-based compensation expense, net of associated tax benefit, of $84.5 million, or $1.61 of Adjusted diluted loss per share, for the third quarter of 2024. Please refer to the *Non-GAAP Financial Measures* section below for further information and a reconciliation of the Company's financial results reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) to the reported adjusted results.\n\n**Record Operating Cash Flow**\n\nThe Company generated $289.1 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter of 2025 and $574.4 million in the first nine months of 2025, both of which set new records for each respective period, and both up significantly compared to $22.6 million and $174.0 million for the same periods last year. The Company's operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2025 was the second-highest result of any quarter. The record operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2025 was largely driven by collections from newer and ongoing projects and, to a much lesser extent, from collections related to recent dispute resolutions.\n\nThe Company expects strong annual operating cash flows to continue well beyond 2025.\n\n**Record Backlog**\n\nThe Company booked $2.0 billion of new awards and contract adjustments in the third quarter of 2025, demonstrating its ongoing success in capturing significant new project opportunities resulting from a combination of its strategic bidding approach and favorable market dynamics, including limited competition in certain markets for some of the largest, most complex projects. This environment, which is supported by strong public and private customer funding and demand, has allowed the Company to differentiate itself and deliver compelling proposals that align with customers' goals and expectations.\n\nAs a result of the strong new awards activity, the Company's backlog grew to a new record of $21.6 billion as of September 30, 2025, up 54% compared to the backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Backlog for the Building and Specialty Contractors segments as of September 30, 2025 also set new records. The most significant new awards and contract adjustments in the third quarter of 2025 included:\n\nThe Company expects its backlog will remain strong due in part to certain Building segment projects currently in the preconstruction phase that are anticipated to advance to the construction phase later this year and in 2026 and 2027. Tutor Perini expects to continue bidding selectively on various project opportunities that will drive long-term shareholder value. The Company continues to have significant project bidding opportunities, particularly on the West Coast, in the Midwest, and in the Indo-Pacific region, and remains well positioned to continue winning its share of new projects over the next several years.\n\n**Significant Balance Sheet Improvements**\n\nTotal debt as of September 30, 2025 was $413 million, down 23% compared to $534 million at the end of 2024. As a result of the record operating cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date in 2025, the Company's cash exceeded its total debt by $283 million as of September 30, 2025, maintaining the Company's balance sheet in a strong net cash position. In addition, the Company's balance of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings (\"CIE\") was $848 million as of September 30, 2025, down $95 million, or 10%, compared to the balance at the end of 2024 and at the lowest level it has been since the second quarter of 2017. This reduction in CIE was primarily driven by the resolution and billing of various previously disputed matters.\n\n**Management Remarks**\n\n\"Tutor Perini's third-quarter results were outstanding across all key metrics and demonstrate our continued business momentum and success in delivering solid operating performance, with healthy profit margins in the Civil and Building segments and a return to profitability in the Specialty Contractors segment,\" said Gary Smalley, Tutor Perini's Chief Executive Officer and President.\n\n\"We are benefiting from favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, which are driving strong market demand for construction services across all our segments. We remain focused on capitalizing on a range of attractive bidding opportunities, which resulted in Tutor Perini securing $2 billion of new awards this quarter, increasing our backlog to a new record of $21.6 billion. We continue to expect the long-duration and higher-margin nature of projects in backlog to translate into significantly higher revenue and earnings over the next several years.\"\n\n\"Our record operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2025 is already well in excess of last year's full-year record cash flow, and we expect to continue generating strong cash flow for the rest of this year and beyond. Furthermore, our earnings to date are considerably higher than expected, enabling us to confidently raise our full-year earnings guidance for the third consecutive quarter,\" added Mr. Smalley.\n\n**Outlook and Raising Guidance**\n\nTutor Perini's business has continued to perform extremely well through the first nine months of 2025, and the Company anticipates solid operating performance and financial results over the rest of this year, with significantly higher revenue and earnings still expected in 2026 and 2027 as various newer large projects advance to the construction phase.\n\nBased on the Company's excellent year-to-date results in 2025 and management's increased confidence in its performance trajectory for the remainder of the year, the Company is raising its 2025 Adjusted EPS guidance, with Adjusted EPS now expected in the range of $4.00 to $4.20 (up from $3.65 to $3.95). Based on current projections, the Company continues to expect that Adjusted EPS for 2026 and 2027 will be significantly higher than the upper end of its increased 2025 guidance. The Company's increased guidance continues to factor in a significant amount of contingency for various unknown or unexpected developments in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThe Company is no longer providing forward-looking guidance for GAAP EPS or a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EPS guidance to GAAP EPS guidance because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting share-based compensation expense, which fluctuates with future share price movements, without unreasonable efforts. Variations in share-based compensation expense could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period.\n\nThe Company continues to see strong demand for its services, driven by well-funded state, local and federal customers that have numerous large-scale, high-priority infrastructure projects planned over the next several years, as well as by certain commercial customers that continue to advance projects for new or renovated buildings in vibrant end markets, such as healthcare, education, and hospitality and gaming.\n\nTutor Perini still does not currently anticipate any significant impacts from recently imposed tariffs, the curtailment of federal funding for certain projects, or the recent federal government shutdown, but continues to closely monitor these issues.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented under GAAP, we are presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional insights that facilitate the comparison of our past and present performance, and they are among the indicators management uses to assess the Company’s financial performance and to forecast future performance. By including these non-GAAP financial measures, we aim to provide investors and stakeholders a clearer understanding of our operating results and enhance transparency with respect to the key financial metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude share-based compensation expense (as well as the tax benefit associated with the expense), include adjusted net income (loss) attributable to the Company and adjusted earnings (loss) per share. We exclude share-based compensation expense because this expense could result in significant volatility in our reported earnings, driven primarily by fluctuations in the expense recognized for certain long-term incentive compensation awards with payouts that are indexed to the Company’s common stock. By adjusting for share-based compensation, our non-GAAP measures present a supplemental depiction of our operational performance and financial health. This approach allows stakeholders to focus on our core operational efficiency and profitability without the variable impact to earnings caused by significant changes in our stock price. Our non-GAAP measures are intended to offer a consistent basis for evaluating the Company’s performance, which management believes is meaningful to stakeholders.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release as calculated by the Company are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\n\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are found in the table below:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | | |  | | |  |  | | |  | | |\n|  | **Three Months Ended  September 30,** | | | | | |  | **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,** | | | | | |\n| *(in millions, except per common share amounts)* |  | **2025** |  |  | **2024** |  |  |  | **2025** |  |  | **2024** |  |\n| Net income (loss) attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation, as reported | $ | 3.6 |  | $ | (100.9 | ) |  | $ | 51.6 |  | $ | (84.3 | ) |\n| Plus: Share-based compensation expense(a) |  | 58.7 |  |  | 16.5 |  |  |  | 120.7 |  |  | 39.0 |  |\n| Less: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense |  | (0.4 | ) |  | (0.1 | ) |  |  | (0.9 | ) |  | (0.5 | ) |\n| Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation | $ | 61.9 |  | $ | (84.5 | ) |  | $ | 171.4 |  | $ | (45.8 | ) |\n|  |  | | |  | | |  |  | | |  | | |\n| Diluted earnings (loss) per common share, as reported | $ | 0.07 |  | $ | (1.92 | ) |  | $ | 0.97 |  | $ | (1.61 | ) |\n| Plus: Share-based compensation expense impact per diluted share |  | 1.09 |  |  | 0.32 |  |  |  | 2.26 |  |  | 0.75 |  |\n| Less: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense per diluted share |  | (0.01 | ) |  | (0.01 | ) |  |  | (0.01 | ) |  | (0.02 | ) |\n| Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per common share | $ | 1.15 |  | $ | (1.61 | ) |  | $ | 3.22 |  | $ | (0.88 | ) |\n\n**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n**Three Months Ended\n  \nSeptember 30,**\n\n**Nine Months Ended****September 30,**\n\n*(in millions, except per common share amounts)*\n\n**2025**\n\n**2024**\n\n**2025**\n\n**2024**\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation, as reported\n\n$\n\n3.6\n\n$\n\n(100.9\n\n)\n\n$\n\n51.6\n\n$\n\n(84.3\n\n)\n\nPlus: Share-based compensation expense(a)\n\n58.7\n\n16.5\n\n120.7\n\n39.0\n\nLess: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense\n\n(0.4\n\n)\n\n(0.1\n\n)\n\n(0.9\n\n)\n\n(0.5\n\n)\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) attributable to Tutor Perini Corporation\n\n$\n\n61.9\n\n$\n\n(84.5\n\n)\n\n$\n\n171.4\n\n$\n\n(45.8\n\n)\n\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share, as reported\n\n$\n\n0.07\n\n$\n\n(1.92\n\n)\n\n$\n\n0.97\n\n$\n\n(1.61\n\n)\n\nPlus: Share-based compensation expense impact per diluted share\n\n1.09\n\n0.32\n\n2.26\n\n0.75\n\nLess: Tax benefit provided on share-based compensation expense per diluted share\n\n(0.01\n\n)\n\n(0.01\n\n)\n\n(0.01\n\n)\n\n(0.02\n\n)\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings (loss) per common share\n\n$\n\n1.15\n\n$\n\n(1.61\n\n)\n\n$\n\n3.22\n\n$\n\n(0.88\n\n)\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ | | |\n| (a) |  | The amount represents share-based compensation expense recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.

  "analyzed_articles": "Record $21.6B Backlog: Why This Builder Has Work Lined Up for Years  \nTPC | 2026-02-18 | Sources: Tutor Perini press releases (Q2 & Q3 2025), Q3 2025 earnings transcript (Motley Fool, 11/05/2025), Los Angeles Business Journal (Jan 2026)\n\nTutor Perini just strapped more cargo onto a very full ship: backlog hit an all-time high of $21.6 billion as of September 30, 2025. That’s not fluff — it’s confirmed work sitting in the pipeline that should drive revenue for years. For a company that builds big, complicated projects, a backlog this large is the equivalent of long-term ticket sales — it’s future revenue visibility, and investors should pay attention.\n\nThis surge didn’t come from one lucky bid. It’s the result of several quarters of aggressive, selective wins and faster project ramp-ups. The company booked $3.1 billion in new awards in Q2 2025 and another $2.0 billion in Q3 2025, including marquee projects such as the roughly $1 billion UCSF Benioff New Children’s Hospital, a $182 million defense project in Guam, and other building- and civil-focused work. More recently, one of Tutor Perini’s subsidiaries landed a pair of Northern California contracts totaling $408 million (a $253M UC Davis utility-plant expansion and a $155M performing-arts building for City College of San Francisco). Put together, that mix shows Tutor Perini is winning both large, long-duration civil work and higher-margin building trades — the combo investors like when they want steadier, growing cash flows.\n\nShow Me the Numbers — the quick scorecard (and what each number means)\n- Backlog: $21.6 billion (Sept 30, 2025) — the company’s confirmed pipeline; more than enough work to support multi-year revenue growth.  \n- Revenue (Q3 2025): $1.42 billion, +31% year-over-year — proof projects are moving from backlog into billing.  \n- Operating cash flow: $289 million (Q3); $574 million (first 9 months of 2025) — think of this as the company’s paycheck after paying suppliers and crews; it’s unusually strong and a key source for debt reduction or returns to shareholders.  \n- Total debt: $413 million (Sept 30, 2025), down from $534M at end-2024; cash exceeded debt by $283M — balance sheet moving from leveraged toward net-cash position.  \n- CIE (costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings): $848 million (Sept 30, 2025), down $95M since year-end 2024 — a lower CIE usually signals fewer unresolved disputes and cleaner working capital.  \n- 2025 adjusted EPS guidance: raised to $4.00–$4.20 (adjusted excludes share-based compensation volatility) — management expects materially better earnings after stripping one-time stock-linked accounting swings.\n\nHere’s what that means for a new investor: overall, this is growth with improving stability. Tutor Perini is moving from a patchwork of legacy issues into a phase where large, higher-margin projects and record cash generation are front-and-center. The company has been converting backlog into billings and cash, shrinking net debt, and raising guidance — all classic signs that operations are trending healthier. Experienced investors will watch two things closely: whether cash flow stays strong as mobils and early payments normalize, and whether the company continues to win high-quality work (not just volume).\n\nThe catch you should know: the biggest fly in the ointment is volatile share-based compensation and the normal risks of large construction contracts. Tutor Perini’s share-based compensation expense has ballooned with the stock rally (it added tens of millions to quarterly G&A), which complicates GAAP earnings — that’s why management highlights “Adjusted EPS.” More fundamentally, big projects carry execution and dispute risks; although CIE is down (good), unresolved disputes and cost overruns on multi-year builds can still hit margins and working capital. Finally, while management says it doesn’t expect tariffs, funding cuts, or government shutdowns to materially impact current projects, changes in public funding or major cancellations would be the sharpest tailwinds to watch for.\n\nBottom line — Tutor Perini looks like a construction company that has turned a corner: a stacked backlog, record cash generation, falling net debt and rising adjusted earnings expectations. For investors starting out, the story is growth backed by cash — but priced with the usual construction risks and some accounting noise from stock-linked pay. If you own the stock or are considering it, watch upcoming cash flow reports and new-award quality (not just headline dollars) — those will tell you whether this momentum sticks."
